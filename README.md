# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis and Deposit Subscription Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data from a recent marketing campaign of a bank, aiming to attract deposit subscriptions. The main challenge is to sift through the data, uncover patterns, and identify key influencing factors that led customers to invest in this bank. The outcome of this analysis is pivotal in enhancing the bank's revenue and understanding the demographics and preferences of the target audience for future marketing strategies.

## Business Objective
To pinpoint client characteristics that indicate a higher likelihood of deposit subscription, thereby amplifying the success rate of the bank's marketing campaigns.

## Technical Objective for Data Science Specialists
Develop a machine learning model to predict a client's likelihood of accepting a deposit account offer, based on their profile. This model is intended to guide data-driven marketing strategies.

## Project Structure

1. **Primary Data Processing**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers to prepare the dataset for further analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Investigate the dataset to find initial patterns and formulate hypotheses.

3. **Feature Selection and Transformation**:
   - Recode and transform data for classification tasks, building upon the understanding of the data structure from previous stages.

4. **Classification Task Solutions: Logistic Regression and Decision Trees**:
   - Build and evaluate the initial predictive models. Learn to fine-tune model parameters to enhance performance for specific algorithms.

5. **Classification Task Solutions: Ensemble Models and Forecasting**:
   - Improve predictions using advanced algorithms and assess which models yield the most accurate forecasts.
